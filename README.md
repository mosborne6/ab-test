# Demo of A/B testing framework with Tesfy
This is purely for demonstration purposes to help illustrate how an open-source framework can be used in an EdgeWorker to provide A/B and multivariate testing.

## Extendable extension logic
jsonLogicExtensions.js can accept additional extensions to augment logic/criteria (such as using wildcards and regex in experiments).
